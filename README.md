Modular Personal Assistant

This is an idea I came up with at 4am to make a personal assistant with a modular command structure.
What I've done here is not the best way to implement it I believe, but I would like to figure out a better way to use it.


I also just realized that the much easier way to accomplish this would be to employ bash aliases and simply write some scripts that those run instead.
